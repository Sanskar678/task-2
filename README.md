# 🚢 Titanic Dataset Analysis (Test Set)

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset (test set) to uncover hidden patterns, relationships, and business insights using data visualization and statistical summaries.

---

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers such as:
- Passenger class (`Pclass`)
- Gender (`Sex`)
- Age
- Family connections (`SibSp`, `Parch`)
- Fare paid
- Embarkation port
- Whether they survived (`Survived`)

> 📌 *Note: This is the test dataset and includes the `Survived` column for analysis purposes.*

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process includes:

- ✅ Missing Value Analysis  
- 📊 Univariate Analysis (distributions of Age, Fare, Class, etc.)  
- 🔁 Bivariate Analysis (Survival rates by gender, class, port)  
- 📦 Boxplots (Age & Fare by Survival)  
- 🔥 Correlation Heatmap
